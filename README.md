### Running the Backend

1. Navigate to the `backend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder and add the following:
   ```plaintext
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The backend will run at `http://localhost:5000`.

5. Use Postman to test backend functionality like creating elections or viewing results. For example:
   - **Create Election:** Send a POST request to `http://localhost:5000/api/elections` with the required fields.

3. Update the `src/api/axios.js` file:
   Ensure the `baseURL` points to your backend server (e.g., `http://localhost:5000/api`).

4. Start the frontend development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
